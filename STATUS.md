# KairoTransformers v1 Status

**Target: 95%. Current completion claim: UNVERIFIED.**

The earlier percentage claim has been retracted. A frozen scope or a populated
`STATUS.yaml` is not evidence that this repository builds, runs, or satisfies
its integration contract.

Current rules:

- `target_score: 95` is a target only.
- `completion_score: unverified` remains until exact-head acceptance executes.
- source/test failures block completion regardless of documentation state.
- platform-gated behavior is not inferred from another host.
- post-v1 exclusions may bound scope, but they cannot hide missing v1 behavior.

Use the repository's real build/test gate and the KairoGameEngine portfolio
acceptance runner. Do not cite this repository as 95% complete until the
accepted exact-head evidence matches the current revision.
